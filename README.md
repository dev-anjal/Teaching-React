#### 01: Basic_CRA

In this section, I worked with **Create React App (CRA)**, a tool to bootstrap React applications. I learned the flow of how a CRA app works, starting from the `index.html` file and how it connects to the `App.jsx` component, which acts as the main component for rendering the app.

Key concepts I covered:

- **Public Folder**: Contains static files, including `index.html` which serves as the root HTML template for the app.
- **Src Folder**: This is where the main app logic and React components are written. I explored how components are structured, how state and props work, and how they interact within the app.
- **Building for Production**: I learned the process of creating a production-ready build, using tools like Webpack for bundling and optimizing the application.
- **Miscellaneous Tools**: I also explored other useful tools in CRA like environment variables, handling assets, and using React Developer Tools for debugging.

#### 02Vite_React

In this section, I learned to set up a React app using **Vite**, a faster, modern bundler. I learned how Vite improves the development process by leveraging native ES modules and providing faster hot-module replacement (HMR).

Key concepts I covered:

- **Vite Setup**: I learned how to create a Vite app with the command:

```bash
npm create vite@latest
```
